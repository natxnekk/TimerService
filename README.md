## 🔧 Usage

### **Creating a Timer**
```lua
local Timer = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.TimerService) -- Adjust path as needed

-- Create a timer that lasts 10 seconds and prints "Timer ended!" when done
local myTimer = Timer.new(10, function()
    print("Timer ended!")
end)
```

### **Starting the Timer**
```lua
myTimer:start()
```

### **Pausing the Timer**
```lua
myTimer:pause()
```

### **Resetting the Timer**
```lua
myTimer:reset(true) -- Pass 'true' to pause after reset
```

### **Checking Timer State**
```lua
print("Is running:", myTimer:getIsRunning()) -- true/false
print("Time left:", myTimer:getTimeLeft())   -- Remaining seconds
```

### **Destroying the Timer**
```lua
myTimer:destroy() -- Cleans up memory
```

---

## 📌 Notes
- The timer **runs in a coroutine** to prevent blocking execution.
- The `endedCallback` function is executed when the timer reaches 0.
- Destroy unused timers to **free memory**.
